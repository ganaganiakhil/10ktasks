  <pre><p>The <b style="color:rgb(250, 0, 0);font-size:larger" >big highlight of the Harley-Davidson X440</b> is its all-new heart. 
    <b> <strong style="color: orange;"> The 440cc engine</strong></b> has been developed from the ground up and <mark>its power and torque output are noteworthy at 25 bhp and 38 Nm,</mark>  respectively. 
    The construction of the engine is simple, with a 2-valve head and air-cooling. Being a long-stroke engine, peak torque is delivered at just 4,000 rpm, and this engine is super tractable, which means commuting speeds will be stress-free. 
    On the high-speed track, I managed to clock a top <strong>speed of 134 kmph</strong> with my 100 kg heft and that really impressive. </pre>
